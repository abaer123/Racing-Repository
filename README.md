# Tanuki Racing Application

Main project for all GitLab hands on events, main project here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-learn-labs/sample-projects/tanuki-racing/-/edit/main/README.md.

This project consists of 5 workshops that can be run synchronously or self-paced, and can be customized on a per-customer basis. Additionally, it contains Golden Demos which model the best practices demonstrated via the hands-on workshops. There is also an AI Sandbox subdirectory in /ai-sandbox which contains sample files that you can use to evaluate the output of GitLab Duo Code Suggestions as well.

**GitLab Fundamentals** - This workshop introduces participants to the basics of working with GitLab. In this lab, participants will learn how to set up a project, work with GitLab project management tools, deploy basic CI/CD pipelines, and learn about security and compliance features offered in our platform.
